  <h3>Personal & Organizational Ethics, Nov 2017</h3>
  <p>
	In this paper I will be discussing my leadership skills and its factors as mentioned in the course text. My leadership skills will be explained in four ways. First of which will be analyzing my strong and weak leadership traits. Then provide a plan to improve the weaker skills. Second, I will analyze my leadership philosophy and how it fits with my work environment. Third, I will analyze the conflict in my work environment and explain how I would handle it as its leader. Fourth, I will culminate the previous three analyses and create an overall explanation of its ethics. 
	In this first analysis I will be examining my strong and weak leadership traits based on chapter two of the text. After completing the course work survey about my leadership skills, I found that my two strongest traits are intelligence and charisma. My leadership intelligence shows how competent I am with understanding the work at hand and team member’s role. This allows me to be a great source of guidance within my organization. In my group we have a term we use for those of us who are the knowledge base. The term we use is Subject Matter Expert. In my job I work with a massive amount of electronics and software. I constantly research new ways to understand emerging computer systems. I find that this helps strengths my leadership intelligence trait. My second strongest leadership trait is my charisma. I find that in one on one conversations I can fairly easily make someone smile or laugh. I lecture a course on a frequent basis and am usually fairly clear and concise with my words. I normally enjoy long conversations with other people and am able to engage with strong empathy. My weak leadership traits include sociability and confidence. I lack confidence because I can sometimes doubt my ability to perform. This doubt can be seen by fellow teammates and cause loss of confidence in my ability to lead them. One cause of this lack of confidence is my low level of leadership experience. My lack of leadership sociability usually arises when I find that I fail to understand the social network within my team. To improve these weak leadership traits, I will discuss an improvement plan I can apply in my current position. With my lack of sociability, it is important that I stay engaged with group functions regardless if it is work related. These can be fun events that take place outside of work and maintains a constant connection with the interactions of group members. I should ask questions about how people feel about each other and learn about the relationships between each other. After which time I should have enough clout for proper leadership sociability. Another great technique for improving sociability is to find interest in any subject that may be of identified with group members. For example, I do not much care for football games when most of my team members are dedicated to it. Despite not liking football I should keep general knowledge to easily engage on the subject with fellow team members. These practices will help me improve my weak traits and push me further in to greater positions of leadership.
	In this section I will be analyzing my leadership philosophy and how it fits in my organization. In the course work pertaining to this chapter I was surveyed to have an authoritarian style of leadership. Though I find that I generally try to be democratic and favor collaboration within a group. Within my organization we have a group of members that create fun events called a booster club in which I am a member of. When we collaborate we generally delegate tasks to other members to accomplish. I find that I always ask for ideas on improving the process with everyone. Generally, my organization is authoritarian in its leadership style. Typically, tasks get transmitted from high headquarters down through a chain of leaders. These tasks aren’t usually up for democratic approval in any way. Tasks usually have specific instructions about how to accomplish them or references of the same. My organization has a history of not providing context about specific end goals that we work towards. At times many members work not knowing the big picture result. This is intentional at times to prevent austere repercussions to our organization. At times our responsibilities as an organization involve timeliness. This timeliness requires efficient and effective commands towards subordinates hence, why we lean towards authoritarian style leadership. 
	In this section I will analyze conflict in my organization. In reference to the course material the most common level of conflict in my organization is content based. One major conflict in my organization involves a recent merge between two teams. These two teams conduct their operations in different ways and are now expected to work together. This content level of conflict eventually turned the merger into a relationship level of conflict. The lack of process cohesion created fights between middle management belonging from each side of the merger. If I were in charge of the conflict as a leader I would have done the following. Before the merge, there was not much in terms of planning and preparation. Leadership of those teams should have collaborated on how the merge will affect operations. Leadership should have also set up ways to resolve issues that will arise after the merge. This includes quick response delegations that can provide solutions to problems before they damage operations. I would have also created a fun event where both groups can mingle and socialize. This would create a better relationship environment between the two groups. 
	The ethics of my organization spans into many different teams across the world. Because of this the environment for each team varies throughout the entire organization. In this section I will be discussing the aspects of my leadership and how it relates to the ethics of my organization. My strong leadership skills are intelligence and charisma. These skills are nurtured by my organizations strive for knowledge and efficiency. One of the values my organization possess is its strive for preparation and information gathering. Because of this, I find that my intelligence skills make me a great leader within the group. Though at times my charisma is perceived as ineffective and menial. My organization is fairly authoritarian in its hierarchy. I find that most of my leadership traits stem from my time and experience at the organization. My team is usually given orders to fulfil without question or democratic review. This is intentionally done to enable quick resolutions to problems and workloads. The ethical problem with this is when an order falls outside the value system of team members. Fortunately, there is a process which a review can be made when divergent ethical orders area made. My organization’s overall ethical climate is strong and upholds common values held by most people. Three major ones we use are integrity, selflessness, and excellence. These values are held highly and constantly reinforced within our groups. Though I do think there is a sense of apathy in regards to certain conflicts that arise within the organization. This apathy I find to be unethical. In the conflict I mentioned in the previous section where the two groups that have merged are now quarreling, there is a small disregard to the conflicts resolution. I find that there are a few causes for this disregard. First of which is that most of the team members generally do not work periods of more than two to three years in one position. This causes problems to go unresolved and neglected. Secondly, I find that the leaders for these groups work at distance locations which removes them from the problem somewhat. As a leader this would be a fairly difficult problem to solve by myself. I would need to delegate subordinate leaders to solve these problems part by part. Another solution is to better reward ethical behavior as mentioned in a study done by the Journal of Business Ethics. (Koh & Boo, 2001) Alternatively, it may be wise to teach the leaders within those two groups to be transformational leaders. Their transformational leaders will provide constant mentorship of the team members and their willingness to improve the work environment. (Carlson & Perrewe, 1995) I find that this will help the two teams resolve the problem within themselves.
	In conclusion, this analysis of my leadership skills and its role within my organization proved to be enlightening. I discussed the style of leadership I possess and how well it interacts in my organization.  I dissected my interactions and provided feedback on improvement. I revealed conflicts and solutions that will better optimize the leader’s time. It seems that leadership isn’t just an idea, one must have the heart and guts to improve. (Cooper, 2000) This has provided me with an improved perspective on myself as a better leader.
